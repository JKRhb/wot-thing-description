    <h2>How to Submit an Erratum?</h2>

    <p>
      Errata are introduced and stored in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-thing-description/issues/">issue list
        for the WoT Thing Description GitHub repository</a>.
      The workflow to add a new erratum is as follows:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        A possible mistake is submitted as issues on GitHub, whose title MUST start
        with <code>[POSSIBLE ERRATA]</code>, e.g. <code>[POSSIBLE ERRATA] This sentence is wrong</code>. Anyone can
        submit the issue. The specification version MAY be indicated in the issue description.
      </li>
      <li>
        The issue MUST be evaluated before it becomes an official errata, which is reserved for mistakes, errors and
        bugs in the REC document.
      </li>
      <li>
        Evaluation of the label MUST happen by the Thing Description Task Force.
        <ol>
          <li>
            If the Task Force is not active anymore, the Web of Things Working Group MUST evaluate it.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the Web of Things Working Group does not exist anymore, the W3C Team or their delegated entity MUST
            evaluate the submission.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Evaluation result MUST be adding a GitHub label with text being either
        <code>Official Substantive Errata TD1.0 Confirmed</code> or
        <code>Official Editorial Errata TD1.0 Confirmed</code>. Note that whether the errata is substantive or editorial
        depends on the errata. If there is implementation impact, it is generally
        a substantive errata.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a GitHub issue is submitted without thinking that it can be Errata, thus not contain
        <code>[POSSIBLE ERRATA]</code> but turns out to be one, it CAN also obtain the label above after an evaluation
        by the Thing Description Task Force. Note that the delegation of the Task Force is NOT REQUIRED to evaluate every new
        issue.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Task Force or the delegation edits the REC document to address the errata with a GitHub Pull Request also containing
        the label <code>Official Errata Fix</code>. In the same Pull Request, the Task Force or the delegation edits the
        corresponding errata.html document manually based on the issue, following the instructions below in this
        document.
      </li>
      <li>
        Resolution to merge the Pull Request MUST be a Web of Things Working Group resolution or a mechanism chosen by
        the delegation.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      If you have problems following this process, but you want nevertheless to report an error, you can also contact
      the staff contact of the Web of Things Working Group, <a href="mailto:ashimura@w3.org">Kaz Ashimura</a>.
